# Linux password temp manager 

The purpose of this project is to create a command line application that allows me to store temp passwords that can be temporarily stored and not saved in the next session for security purposes. There is times when I need to store temporary passwords for the sake of a video, educational games, etc. 

This project used bash and linode to create an Ubuntu 23.04 server.
